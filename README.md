# K Means Clustering Animated Demo

## Introduction:

This project demonstrates the K Means Clustering algorithm using a Streamlit web application. The application generates random data points and clusters them using K Means algorithm. It visualizes the clusters dynamically using Plotly.

## Usage:

Once you run the Streamlit app, you will see a sidebar with options to select the number of clusters and a button to proceed to the next iteration. You can visualize the clusters forming dynamically with each iteration. There is also an option to reset the clustering process.

## File Descriptions:

- **app.py**: This is the main Python script containing the Streamlit app code.
- **requirements.txt**: Contains the list of Python libraries required to run the project.
